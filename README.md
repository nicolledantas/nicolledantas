- 👋 Hi, I’m @nicolledantas
- 👀 I’m interested in machine learning, criptography and learning multiple coding languages lol
- 🌱 I’m currently starting my coding journey throughout online courses, such as CS50x
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on fun, new and futuristic projects related to cotidian life, facilitation and stuff related to games... you know, a typical gamer girl here
- 📫 How to reach me... when I decide to make something on my own, I'll put something here... maybe.
